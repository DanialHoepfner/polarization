This project contains three files: polarization.do a short stata .do file to generate a measure developed by Esteban and Rey. 
(As well as two alternate datasets for those using STATA 13 or 11/12)
This file is general and describes the steps of the program. 
The other two files are a .do and .dta file which shows an example of the code in use. 
Code was written in STATA 13, most recently run on STATA 14, and since it doesn't use any advanced functions, 
there is not much reason to suspect it wouldn't work on earlier versions.

If running STATA 13 add 13 to use file name.
If running older version of STATA(11/12) add old to use file name.
