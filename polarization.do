/*This file creates a measure of polarization without reference to another
variable(i.e. does not require a second variable to group respondents, such as
Republican or Democrat).The measure was derived by Esteban and Rey in 
Econometrica and isused to assess the degree of polarization of level one 
variables in different level 2 clusters(For example survey responents in 
countries or students in schools). See the article for derivation of the measure
and a discussion of its properties. 
Joan-Maria Esteban and Debraj Ray. On the measurement of polarization. 
Econometrica, 62(4):819â€“851, 1994.*/

gen MEAS=round(MEASURE,.1) /*If the measure is continuous rounding is 
necesary to limit the time to compute the statistic as the rough number of 
calculations is the number of unique values squared, which increases quickly.
This step is not necessary in ordinal measures, provided few enough categories*/

if the measure used is missing in that level 2 unit (recode POLAR=0 if MEAS==.)*/

/*Statistic is basically the proportion of each pair of categories raised to 
a polarization sensitivity term and multiplied by the absolute difference between 
the scores associated with those two categories(see article for equation and 
demonstration of the properties of the measure).
